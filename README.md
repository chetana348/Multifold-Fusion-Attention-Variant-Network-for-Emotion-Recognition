## Abstract

Multimodal emotion recognition has emerged as a critical challenge in affective computing, requiring the effective integration of diverse and asynchronous input sources. This paper introduces a **Multifold Fusion Attention Variant (MFAV)** that selectively emphasizes modality-specific and cross-modal features through a hierarchical fusion mechanism. MFAV employs a dual-stage attention pipeline â€” comprising intra-modality attention and cross-modality interaction â€” to dynamically refine emotional cues from audio, video, and text. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard emotion recognition benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization across variable emotion contexts.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Modular architecture supporting visual, textual, and audio modalities
- Hierarchical attention mechanism for intra- and inter-modality fusion
- Lightweight design enabling faster inference without compromising accuracy
- Superior performance on emotion recognition benchmarks

## ðŸš€ Novelty and Contributions

- **Multifold Fusion Strategy**: Introduces a sequential attention fusion variant that models modality correlations more effectively than traditional parallel fusion.
- **Adaptive Attention Blocks**: Dynamically learn importance weights for each modality and their interactions.
- **Emotion-Specific Embedding Alignment**: Ensures semantic alignment of emotional cues across modalities to boost recognition robustness.
